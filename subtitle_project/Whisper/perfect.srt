1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I found a love for me

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Darling, just die right in

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Follow my lead

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I found a girl

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Beautiful and sweet

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I never knew you were

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The someone waiting for me

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because we were just kids when we fell in love

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Not knowing what it was

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will not give you up

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This time

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Darling, just kiss me slow

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Your heart is all I own

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And in your eyes, you're old in mine

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
With you between my arms

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Barefoot on the cross

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Listening to our favorite song

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When you said you looked at me

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I whispered underneath my breath

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You heard it, darling

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You look perfect tonight

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, I found a woman

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Stronger than anyone I know

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She shares my dreams I hold

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And someday I'll share her home

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I found a love

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To carry more than just my secrets

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
To carry love and to carry children of our own

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are still kids, but we're so in love

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Fighting against all odds

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I know we'll be alright

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This time

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Darling, just hold my hand

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We're gonna be your men

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll sing a future in the eye

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
With you between my arms

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Barefoot on the cross

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Listening to our favorite song

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When I saw you in that dress

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Looking so beautiful

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't deserve this

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Darling, you look perfect tonight

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Darling, you look perfect

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
With you between my arms

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Barefoot on the cross

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Listening to our favorite song

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When I have faith in what I see

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now I know I have met an angel

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In person

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She looks perfect

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't deserve this

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You look perfect tonight

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm dancing in the dark
