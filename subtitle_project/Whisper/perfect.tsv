0	10000	I found a love for me
10000	14000	Darling, just die right in
14000	18000	Follow my lead
18000	21000	I found a girl
21000	25000	Beautiful and sweet
25000	28000	I never knew you were
28000	32000	The someone waiting for me
32000	37000	Because we were just kids when we fell in love
37000	41000	Not knowing what it was
41000	45000	I will not give you up
45000	48000	This time
48000	52000	Darling, just kiss me slow
52000	56000	Your heart is all I own
56000	62000	And in your eyes, you're old in mine
62000	69000	Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
69000	73000	With you between my arms
73000	77000	Barefoot on the cross
77000	81000	Listening to our favorite song
81000	84000	When you said you looked at me
84000	88000	I whispered underneath my breath
88000	91000	You heard it, darling
91000	95000	You look perfect tonight
101000	104000	Well, I found a woman
104000	108000	Stronger than anyone I know
108000	111000	She shares my dreams I hold
111000	116000	And someday I'll share her home
116000	120000	I found a love
120000	124000	To carry more than just my secrets
124000	130000	To carry love and to carry children of our own
130000	135000	We are still kids, but we're so in love
135000	139000	Fighting against all odds
139000	143000	I know we'll be alright
143000	146000	This time
146000	150000	Darling, just hold my hand
150000	154000	We're gonna be your men
154000	160000	I'll sing a future in the eye
160000	168000	Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
168000	172000	With you between my arms
172000	176000	Barefoot on the cross
176000	179000	Listening to our favorite song
179000	182000	When I saw you in that dress
182000	185000	Looking so beautiful
185000	189000	I don't deserve this
189000	194000	Darling, you look perfect tonight
199000	206000	Darling, you look perfect
206000	213000	Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
213000	217000	With you between my arms
217000	221000	Barefoot on the cross
221000	225000	Listening to our favorite song
225000	228000	When I have faith in what I see
228000	232000	Now I know I have met an angel
232000	235000	In person
235000	238000	She looks perfect
238000	242000	I don't deserve this
242000	247000	You look perfect tonight
255000	260000	I'm dancing in the dark
