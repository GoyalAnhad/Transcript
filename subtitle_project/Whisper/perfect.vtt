00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I found a love for me

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Darling, just die right in

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Follow my lead

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I found a girl

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Beautiful and sweet

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I never knew you were

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
The someone waiting for me

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Because we were just kids when we fell in love

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Not knowing what it was

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I will not give you up

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
This time

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Darling, just kiss me slow

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Your heart is all I own

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
And in your eyes, you're old in mine

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
With you between my arms

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Barefoot on the cross

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Listening to our favorite song

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
When you said you looked at me

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
I whispered underneath my breath

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
You heard it, darling

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
You look perfect tonight

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, I found a woman

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Stronger than anyone I know

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
She shares my dreams I hold

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
And someday I'll share her home

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I found a love

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
To carry more than just my secrets

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
To carry love and to carry children of our own

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
We are still kids, but we're so in love

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Fighting against all odds

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
I know we'll be alright

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
This time

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Darling, just hold my hand

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
We're gonna be your men

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
I'll sing a future in the eye

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
With you between my arms

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Barefoot on the cross

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Listening to our favorite song

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
When I saw you in that dress

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Looking so beautiful

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
I don't deserve this

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Darling, you look perfect tonight

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
Darling, you look perfect

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
With you between my arms

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Barefoot on the cross

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Listening to our favorite song

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
When I have faith in what I see

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Now I know I have met an angel

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
In person

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
She looks perfect

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
I don't deserve this

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
You look perfect tonight

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm dancing in the dark
